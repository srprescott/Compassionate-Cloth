                       <p class="p">Compassionate Cloth is a diaper bank and sharing program that serves Alliance, Canton and surrounding areas. We run on donations by local families and businesses in the form of cloth diapers, cloth diapering supplies and other baby related items. Our mission is to educate needy families on the basics of  cloth diapering and provide cloth diapering resources to help with their diapering needs. We provide information on using cloth diapers, how to properly care for cloth diapers, and when available we loan approved families cloth diapers to help offset some of the costs of diapering their child.</p>

                        <p class="p">Compassionate Cloth is a diaper bank that works with low income and needy families. We take our donated diapers from local families and match them with a family in need. Families in need fill out an application to receive diapers which is then reviewed by a Compassionate Cloth volunteer. After a family is approved they are provided with information on how to care for their cloth and take a small “cloth 101” class. Once the families child turns 3 or is potty trained we ask for the diapers to be returned so that they can benefit another family! Diapers are sanitized properly between families to assure they are fresh and ready to use for each baby! </p>
